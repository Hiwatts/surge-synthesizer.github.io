Surge XT 1.3.4 contains bugfixes, a few expanded features, and some infrastructure changes as we head towards 1.4 and Shortcircuit XT.
1.3.3 was released the same day as 1.3.4, and had a single bug which led us to immediately fix and re-release.

## DSP

- Updated Wavetable and Window oscillators to correctly work with full-range 16 bit WT files
  - This means that all the factory wavetable files from Bitwig Studio are loadable in Surge XT
- Updated the .wt format documentation to clarify some issues with 15-bit vs 16-bit range

## Open Sound Control

- Surge XT Effects plugin now supports OSC
- Refactoring for the core OSC message types
- Resetting tuning via OSC will now refresh the Tuning Editor
- Fixed a bug when parsing some modulation mappings sent via OSC

## Command Line and Python Interface

- Implemented handling of input and output audio busses
- CLI can now run without checking `stdin` to quit, for daemon-style operation
- Correctly handle tempo stored in patches and update PPQ position in the Python evaluator
- Python bindings can handle input and output audio streams

## Smaller Changes and Fixes
- Updated all LFO and Step Seq presets, activating the LFO EG where it was disabled
- Renamed the SILM (extended ring modulation) modes
- Added cycle length (in seconds) display to the LFO Rate tooltip
- Renamed Extend Range option for Pitch Bend Up/Down parameters to "Use Decimal Values"
- Fixed some inconsistent parameter defintions and formatting for FM2 and the Frequency Shifter effect
- Cleaned up the voice state when leaving latch mode, fixing a bug when moving from Latch mode to mono modes.

## Infrastructure

- Added warning flags for newer clang versions
- Upgraded SIMDE to version 0.8.2; SIMDE will now be used for any non-x86 platform
- Rebased our JUCE fork to JUCE 7.0.12
